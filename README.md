# Audio-and-Video-Player

Actually I should call it Oscar's player. The reason I set up this project is that I found there is no players in my Laptop days ago when I want to listen a music. So I think why don't I write my own player? And this is a good opportunity for me to review the c# techniques. Then I can't wait to start it.  

But like I mentioned above, I actually want to have one player which allows me to listen to some music, so the first thing I should finish as soon as possible is to implement the basic music play function and then I will improve it. I don't want to make the name of Oscar's player a joke. Lol~  

And another important thing about this project is that I believe that I can learn a lot from this small task. In fact, the scale of this project is determined by how many functions I want to do. When I was in China, I saw some awesome players which support some cool function, like downloading the video resources, playing the video/audio in real-time and decoding tens of different format audio/video files. They are really cool. Thus, this project can also be a challenge. I am so exciting now. Let's do it.
